Profile: I am a software engineer with 10+ years of experience in embedded software and graphical user interface (GUI) development. My main objective is to further develop myself as a software engineer. <br /> I am experienced in C, C++ & C# programming languages in many software development environment. I have experienced in embedded system software with multi core DSPs & MCUs, Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), object oriented programming (OOP), Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS), Unified Modelling Language (UML), design patterns, state machines, data structures, multithreading & asynchronous programming, compiling & linking processes, device drivers, APIs, HAL, IRQs & ISRs, using debugging tools in many projects. I also have a little embedded linux & parallel programming with CUDA experience in different projects. I am also familiar with software version tracking tools like Tortoise SVN, Gitlab & agile software development / continuous integration tools like Jira, Jenkins. <br /> I have high level knowledge of electro optical / thermal imaging systems (NUC, BPR, CLAHE), laser defense systems & INS/GPS systems. Also have knowledge about hardware test setups / ATEs. I have graduate level electronics hardware design and debugging skills.<br /> I am eager to learn new technologies and information. Therefore, I attended many on-site educations, and  in my free time, I follow some online software courses over Udemy, Coursera, Youtube, Medium etc. platforms.

The main aim of the project was to design a Quadrotor with PIC18F4420 MCU, Sparkfun 6 axis freedom gyro, ESC, 4 motors (10000rev/min, 16A) propellers, and carbon fiber skeleton. We also had a camera under quadrotor to get images or videos. There was a Kalman filter implementation by software also. Every software component in order to make quadrotor fly in a stable way, was written by ourselves.
